# KNN

In this project, we apply the k-nearest neighbors classifier on the Ionosphere Dataset. 
* First, the data is examined and pre-processed. 
* Second, we normalize and split the data into the train and val sets. 
* Then, we apply KNN with different distance types, weight types, number of neighbors. 
* Finally, we print a confusion matrix and classification report.
